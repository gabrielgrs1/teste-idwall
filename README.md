## Used Libraries
* [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
* [Sneaker](https://github.com/Hamadakram/Sneaker)
* [AHBottomNavigation](https://github.com/aurelhubert/ahbottomnavigation)
* [okHttpLogInterceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor)
* [FacebookShimmer](https://github.com/facebook/Shimmer)


## How It Works

User informs an invalid email and triggers the `login` button. After this it is redirected to the `Husky image preview screen` and you can navigate between the categories in the `navigation bar` below. If you want to see the photo in more detail the user can click on the photo and see it in its actual size.


## Decisions taken during development
  - Library decisions:
    - **Butterknife**: I decided to use butterknife to increase productivity at the time of bind and listeners from some views
    - **Retrofit**: I decided to use the retrofit to consume the API's for facilitating the treatment of callbacks, speed in the transmission and being a library that is very common in the day-to-day of most mobile development companies.
